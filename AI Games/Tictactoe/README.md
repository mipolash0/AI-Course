‚ùå‚≠ï Tic-Tac-Toe with Smart AI (Minimax) ‚Äî Play & Challenge Your Brain!
Welcome to this classic Tic-Tac-Toe game with a twist: the computer opponent uses the Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to make smart moves! Whether you‚Äôre a beginner or just want a fun challenge, this game has you covered.

üéØ Game Highlights
Interactive GUI: Built with Tkinter for a simple and clean interface.

Player vs Computer: You play as X, AI plays as O.

Intelligent AI: Uses Minimax algorithm to plan ahead and block or win.

üß† Behind the Scenes
The board is a 3x3 grid controlled by buttons.

Each move updates the board state.

The Minimax algorithm evaluates all possible future moves up to a limited depth (2 moves ahead) for the AI.

The AI chooses moves to maximize its chance of winning or drawing.

Alpha-beta pruning optimizes the Minimax to skip unnecessary branches, making AI moves faster.

‚öôÔ∏è Customization
Change depth in minimax() for harder or easier AI.

Adjust board size or win length (currently 3x3, 3 in a row to win).

Enhance UI with colors or animations.
